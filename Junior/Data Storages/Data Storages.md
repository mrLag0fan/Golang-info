## Creates and modifies database objects
While operating with a database, businesses frequently require modifications to database objects. In the context of SQL databases, statements are primarily divided into two key categories: Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML). DDL statements are employed to construct and alter the structure of tables or other objects within a database, whereas DML statements are used to manipulate the data residing in these tables.
## Generates dummy database data for testing and development purposes
Setting up an effective staging environment necessitates data similar to that of the production environment. This task can be challenging if the necessary data hasn't been collected yet or if it's too sensitive to use. Therefore, the generation of dummy data for development and testing becomes crucial. The automation of this dummy data creation not only boosts the quality of the product but also improves the efficiency of the entire development process.
## Orders and groups data from a database using query language
To streamline operations on the information within the database, the query language offers capabilities to group, order, or sort data based on specific use cases. The use of ordering operators enables the fetching of data in either ascending or descending sequence, while grouping serves to streamline the consolidation of data with identical values into summarized structures.
## Uses database data aggregation techniques to optimise data analysis
The aggregation function is critical in facilitating and improving certain database operations. Often used alongside other queries, aggregation is key to producing efficient outcomes. For example, it might be employed during data grouping processes to create reports expediently or derive insights from the database in the most optimal way.
