## What is the difference between the implementation of different indexed F`or` loop types (usual/basic, continued, "while", forever)
## How many and what exact values could be taken from each iteration on the map with the range form of F`or` loop?
## How many and what exact values could be taken from each iteration on slice/array with range form of `For` loop?
## How to omit to get value on iteration with range form of F`or` loop?
## Is it possible to finish iteration in the middle of the execution/cycle?
