Choosing specific data from one or more sources is a pivotal function when dealing with any type of database. While the process may seem straightforward, it's crucial that data retrieval operations are optimally designed so as not to impair the performance of the associated application.

Databases facilitate this through the provision of a query language, which enables the selection and retrieval of data that aligns with the predefined criteria.
